Theres no way for the program to infer all of the sun signs
hard coding was necessary

.new = the class will create a new instance of itself// call the method initialize on the new object.
 Doing so it will simply pass all the arguments that you passed to .new on to the method initialize.

 Require_relative = referring to a file that is relative to the current file you are working 
 on (basically, within the same project directory)

Require = Is a method that is used when you want to reference and execute code that is not written in your current file

select = returns a new object (e.g. array) filled with only those original items where the block you gave it returned true

class = A Class Method is a piece of functionality that belongs to that class, but is not tied to any particular single instance.

object =

instance methids :can only be called on a particular instance of the class.


changes made: represented my resources as objects instead of hashes

shebang :It tells the program loader what command to use to execute the file

different variables: 4 types, local instance class global

RC :library that makes web requests
JSON PARSE: parses the response into a hash
Response.body : the data of the request

self: allows the program to use the data its calling on in other places

each :The each iterator returns all the elements of an array or a hash.
